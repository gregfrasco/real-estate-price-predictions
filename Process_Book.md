## Problem

The housing market is known for its challenges and opportunities. One of those opportunities is finding a fixer upper or flipping a house. When searching a house to flip or renovate, one of the major challenges is how to take into account the risk vs reward. Zillow, Redfin, and other leading real estate platforms provide you with a price estimate of the home’s current market value, but doesn’t factor in condition.

## Solution

The goal of this project is to find and analyze houses on the market, determine if the house is flippable and estimate the market value for a home after renovations. We plan on building an interactive website to educate the buyer of the potential value of the home. Our team plans on building a machine learning model that factors in listings from MLS to identify the homes value, and identify potential flips.

## Project Plan

### Machine Learning Model

| Milestone                                                                                                                    | Leader | Estimated Time | Status  |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|----------------|---------|
| Classify houses that have been bought and sold in a relatively short time period with a higher sales price.                  | TBD    | 1 week         | Planned |
| Use unsupervised methods like clustering to identify unique attributes to locate houses that could potentially be renovated. | TBD    | 1.5 weeks      | Planned |
| Build a housing price model that factors in a home with and without renovations.                                             | TBD    | 1.5 weeks      | Planned |

### Frontend Application

| Milestone                                                       | Leader | Estimated Time | Status  |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------|--------|----------------|---------|
| Wireframe Application Design                                    | TBD    | 1 week         | Planned |
| Develop Listing out a listing view with post renovation prices. | TBD    | 1.5 weeks      | Planned |
| Build a listing view to find help find homes to renovate.       | TBD    | 1.5 weeks      | Planned |

### Backend Application

| Milestone                                                                             | Leader | Estimated Time | Status  |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|----------------|---------|
| Define an RESTful Spec to allow the frontend to interact with the data and ML models. | TBD    | 1 week         | Planned |
| Build a RESTful api with stub data to start integration with the frontend             | TBD    | 1 week         | Planned |
| Integrate backend with model and data.                                                | TBD    | 1 week         | Planned |
| Deploy Application to AWS.                                                            | TBD    | 1 week         | Planned |
