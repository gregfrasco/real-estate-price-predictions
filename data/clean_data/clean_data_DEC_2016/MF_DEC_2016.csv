The sale includes the real estate as well as restaurant equipment + fixtures. For a restauranteur or someone in the food service business, this is a rare opportunity to own your own space and have monthly rental income to boot. For the investor, there are nice returns in renting the existing building out, or by potentially expanding the building. For the developer, the property is a part of the JP/Rox rezoning effort, which recommends allowing for up to 55' of height on this parcel.
