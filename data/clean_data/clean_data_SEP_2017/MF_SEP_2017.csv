What you see isn't all you get. There is a two unit residential home on this property but the value lies in the fact that it's zoned for commercial use and surrounded by business. High traffic count. TOWN WATER AND SEWER. Building was originally open, and could be again, for retail use.  You can collect rent while you are making your plans. Tenants' lease can end upon 60 day notice. Could make an interesting location for alternative medicine practitioners or other professionals. Because it can become open space inside, there are many possibilities. Building could be taken down to create an open site. May possibly be  reconfigured to provide more rooms for University students as it's only 21 minutes to UMass according to MapQuest.
