# Team Charter

Teams do their best work and are happier when they agree on how they want to work together before beginning a project. Think about past successful projects and what they had in common, and add it to the list.

Here are some ideas that have worked well in the past:

- **Assume best intentions** - everyone wants to succeed and wants the team to do well, so we start there

- **Embrace creative disagreement** - conflict can be productive when it’s about the task at hand and different approaches to the problem. Lean into and work through disagreements to get the best outcome, but never make the conflict personal. (Another good phrase for this is _“strong opinions, lightly held”_).

- **Share the work** - research shows that teams do their best work when everyone contributes. Know when to step back, and when to step up.

- **Over-communicate** - we are relying on each other to meet deadlines and get through a lot of work. It’s our job to share statuses, ask questions, and ask for help in advance so that we can support each other and get work in on time.

## Rhythm of Work

Weekly meeting: proposed time is 11am EST on Tuesdays (right before class), with an additional block on Thursdays at the same time if needed.

Slack status updates: proposed slack status updated M, W, and F by 5pm starting week of 20th with a summary of what you’re working on, questions, and anything else. 

## Code Changes

- All code changes must be in pull requests and a reviewer must be tagged

- All PRs should have a good description as well as testing steps for reviewers

- Reviewer should attempt to review and provide feedback on the same day (or within a few hours when closer to the deadline)

- When approved, PR owner will *squash commits* and merge the request, deleting the PR branch after merge
